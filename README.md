## Personal blog (depreciated)

Here are some things that I've discovered while working on this site:

**I'm not a fan of templates** - I'd much rather a clunky half working site that I've designed than wrestle with a template that will never quite feel right.

**I like static** - I quite like writing this in a text file and then committing it, I think anything that requires me to login and use an online editor would be another thing stopping me from actually writing anything.

**Stick with what I know (sort of)** - I ended up using React with an Express back-end that reads Markdown files, could have been simpler, but also could have been way more complicated and you wouldn't be reading this, as I would still be changing frameworks every two weeks. After getting it all working, I realised that I couldn't host it anywhere for free without it taking 30 seconds to spin up, so I rewrote the whole Markdown thing for the front-end.

This is my current setup:

- Typescript
- React
- React router
- Emotion
- Chakra (the styled system part not the components)
- Badly written front-matter parser ðŸ« 
- ~~Node.js~~
- ~~Express~~
- Hosted for free on Netlify
